This example shows how to use [ports] (as opposed as [streams]) to perform asynchronous I/O.  Here
the [scale] actor multiplies each value token, read on stream [i1] by a factor [k] provided by input
port [i2].  The initial value of [k] is 2. According the event file "factors.txt" attached to port
[i2], this value is changed to 10 at time t=100.
The [scale] actor also produced the value 100 on output port [o2] each time it finishes the processing of 
line of tokens.
